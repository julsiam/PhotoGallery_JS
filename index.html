            <p><b> Author: </b> Binibining Mia <br><b>Genre:</b> Romace, Historical Fiction <br><b> Language:</b>
                Filipino, English <br><b> Status:</b> Published, Available in Wattpad <br><b> Synopsis: </b>
                Carmelita Montecarlos was the youngest daughter of San Alfonso’s wealthiest family, while Juanito
                Alfonso
                was the son of the most powerful and influential gobernadorcillo. An agreement solidified their love
                future. They were bound to fall in love, which an agreement guaranteed. They were to marry on the day
                of
                Carmelita’s 20th birthday.
                However, on the day of their grand wedding, Juanito was shot. Nobody knew who had done it. Everyone
                assumed
                that this would be the end of their tragedy. That just like their souls, their tragic romance had gone
                to
                the afterlife. But fate had different plans.
                br
                The laws of nature will bend. After more than 104 years, Carmela, the fourth generation of the
                Montecarlos
                clan, will be born on a leap year — the same day Carmelita was born. A short trip to San Alfonso for
                her
                20th birthday will give her rebellious life a whimsical twist. Through a diary, she’ll go back in time
                and
                the Carmela of 2016 will meet Juanito of 1892. </p>
